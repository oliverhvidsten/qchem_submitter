# qchem_submitter
This tool is a more lightweight alternative to the atomate/fireworks/jobflow architecture that has been built.
To be used in simpler situations where the other solution would be unwieldly

This code contains three elements of functionality: input creation, slurm submission, output parsing

### Pre-use Setup
- create a folder called `./init_mols`
- save all xyz files to be optimized in this folder

### Step 1:
Run `python create_optimization_inputs.py <hpc name>`\
Creates all necessary input files including the submit scripts for the hpc you are using

### Step 2:
Run `python submit_jobs.py`\
Submits the scripts generated by Step 1 to SLURM 

### Step 3:
Run `python read_outputs.py`\
Parses qchem output files and saves results to a JSON file in the job's folder
